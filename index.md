# Hello Everyone!

![](https://i.imgur.com/HM3DqPB.jpg)

I am Vinayak Nayak, a Mechanical Engineer currently working as a Data Sciences Engineer at [Okkular](https://www.okkular.io/) with functional knowledge of Computer Vision, NLP & Tabular Data Machine Learning. 

I built this personal website as a space where I can share my views, ideas, projects that I dabbled with, and more. 

I enjoy solving vision problems like Image Classification, Image Retrieval (Content Based Recommendations) and I'm also quite familiar with several NLP problems such as Text Classification, Named Entity Recognintion and so on. [Here's my github](https://github.com/ElisonSherton) where you can see my engagements with such problem statements.

Besides that, I really love watching anime especially from the `shounen`, `sports` and  `slice of life` genres. By far, [Kuroko no basket](https://myanimelist.net/anime/11771/Kuroko_no_Basket) and [Haikyuu](https://myanimelist.net/anime/20583/Haikyuu) are really at the top amongst my list of most favorite anime! Apart from watching anime, I also enjoy reading light novels and short stories which irrespective of being fiction or otherwise incite thoughts in me and give a new perspective to view life.

I hope you'll enjoy reading my posts and if you do, I would love to hear your reactions and take constructive criticism to improve my content and evolve. We're all always learning aren't we :blush!
