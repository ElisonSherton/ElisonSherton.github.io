# Site Announcement

Hi everyone!

I am super-excited to start this personal web-site.

A little bit about me:

I am Vinayak Nayak, based out of Mumbai, India. I am a Mechanical Engineer, AI Developer at [okkular](https://www.okkular.io/), Curious Human & a Lifelong Learner.

- I love the science of using Data to gather insights, solve problems and make our lives more convenient!

- I also like to share my learnings and knowledge through blog posts to facilitate an easy welcome to newcomers so they don't have to face the problems I went through when developing projects. That is the main intent behind starting this web portfolio.

- Besides these, I am an otaku, an occasional reader and a big Studio Ghibli fan!
