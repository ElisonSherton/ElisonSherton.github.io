This post is built for documentation and self-revision and wouldn't be structured very well. It is written with the intent to remember basic concepts of mathematics which will inevitably be needed to study any discipline which involves quantitative analysis.

## Natural Numbers

Also called counting numbers which are used in daily life for counting things. 

\\[ \mathbb{N} = {1, 2, 3, ....} \\]

Some people count 0 as a natural number as well and to include that in the notation, they specify a subscript 0 as follows

\\[ \mathbb{N}_0 = {1, 2, 3, ....} \\]

However, some others call the set of natural numbers with 0 included as Whole Numbers; so a set difference of Natural Numbers from Whole Numbers will only involve the number 0. 

For the sake of the [IITM Online Degree in Programming and Data Science - Basic Mathematics 1](https://youtu.be/WEC6jPWvoj8), consider 0 as a part of natural numbers.

## Integers

Natural Numbers with negative numbers included are called Integers.

\\[ \mathbb{Z} = {..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...} \\]

## Division Notation

If `a` divides `b` evenly i.e. no remainder, it is denoted as `a | b`.

Alternatively we call `a` as a factor of b.

If `a` doesn't divide `b`, we notate this as \\( a \nmid b \\)

Also, `a` is a factor of `b` if `a | b`

## Prime Numbers

*p* is prime iff it has two factors, the number `1` and itself.

Every number could be decomposed into prime factors and since `1` has only 1 factor which is itself, the smallest prime factor is the number `2`.

## Rational Numbers

Numbers which are of the form \\(  \frac{p}{q} \\) where q does not divide p evenly are called rational numbers. `p` is called numerator and `q` is called denominator.

They are represented with the symbol \\( \mathbb{Q} \\)

Their representation is not unique for eg.

\\[  \frac{3}{10} = \frac{6}{20} = \frac{12}{40} \\]

They can be represented in reduced form which is a fraction such that the numerator and denominator don't have any common factors.

> For every integer we have the concept of a next and previous integer but nothing of such sort exists in Rationals. Because given any two numbers, there'll always be an average number in between them.

**\\(  \therefore \\) Rationals are dense, integers are discrete**

## Real Numbers

Numbers which are on the number line but cannot be represented as \\(  \frac{p}{q} \\ are called Irrational Numbers eg. \\(  \sqrt{2} \\), \\(  \PI \\), square roots of not perfect squaresA.

Together, both Irrational and Rational Numbers are called Real Numbers and they're denoted as \\( \mathbb{R} \\). Real numbers are also dense by same logic as Rational Numbers.
