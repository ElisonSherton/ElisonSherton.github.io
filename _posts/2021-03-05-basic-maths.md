This post is built for documentation and self-revision and wouldn't be structured very well. It is written with the intent to remember basic concepts of mathematics which will inevitably be needed to study any discipline which involves quantitative analysis.

## Natural Numbers

Also called counting numbers which are used in daily life for counting things. 

\\[ \mathbb{N} = {1, 2, 3, ....} \\]

Some people count 0 as a natural number as well and to include that in the notation, they specify a subscript 0 as follows

\\[ \mathbb{N}_0 = {1, 2, 3, ....} \\]

However, some others call the set of natural numbers with 0 included as Whole Numbers; so a set difference of Natural Numbers from Whole Numbers will only involve the number 0. 

For the sake of the [IITM Online Degree in Programming and Data Science - Basic Mathematics 1](https://youtu.be/WEC6jPWvoj8), consider 0 as a part of natural numbers.

## Integers

Natural Numbers with negative numbers included are called Integers.


\\[ \mathbb{Z} = {..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...} \\]

\\[ x = y^2 \\]


## Division Notation

If `a` divides `b` evenly i.e. no remainder, it is denoted as `a | b`.

Alternatively we call `a` as a factor of b.

If `a` doesn't divide `b`, we notate this as $x\nmid y$
