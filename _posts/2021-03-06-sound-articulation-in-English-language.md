***Caveat***:

This post is built for documentation and self-revision and may not be structured very well. 

The kind of sounds we make have two aspects: places through which we speak and the manner of articulation.

**PLACES OF SPEECH**

- **bilibial sounds**: When both lips touch while making the sound eg. p, b.
- **labio-dental sounds**: When lower lip touches upper teeth eg. f, v
- **dental sounds**: When tip of toungue touches teeth th, d
- **alveolar sounds**: When tip of tongue touches alveolar ridge eg. s, z
- **retroflex sounds**: Tongue folds backwards before making the sound eg. ta, da

**MANNER OF ARTICULATION**

- **stop sounds**: Stop the exhaling flow of air to produce sound
- **fricative sounds**: Neither stop nor easily pass, some resistance to flow of air eg. f, v, th, d etc.
