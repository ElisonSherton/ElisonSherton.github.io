This post is built for documentation and self-revision and wouldn't be structured very well. It is written with the intent to remember basic concepts of mathematics which will inevitably be needed to study any discipline which involves quantitative analysis.


## Functions

A function is a rule that maps an input to an output

Need to specify input and output

*Domain*: Set of inputs

*Codomain*: Output set of possible values

*Range*: Actual values that the output can take

\\[ f \: X \mapsto Y \\] 

Domain is X and Codomain is Y

We can associate every relation with each function.

\\[ R_{sq} = \{ \(x, y\) \| x, y \in \mathbb{R}, y = x^2 \\] 

This demands that the relation should follow

\\[ R_{f}  \subset \ domain(f) \times range(f) \\]

This relation must be
- Defined for every element in the domain
- It must produce a single value for every input element i.e. it must map to only one element.


## Injective Function

A function is injective if different input produces different output (one to one)

i.e. 

\\[ x_1 \neq x_2 \ f(x_1) \neq f(x_2) \\]

eg. a Straight line

## Surjective function

Range is the codomain i.e. onto function

Square root is not a surjective function.

## Bijective function

1 - 1 correspondance between input and output. 

> A function is bijective iff it's both surjective and injective.

***Establishing a bijection ensures the two sets have the same cardinality, For infinite sets, this is the only way we can estimate their cardinality.***
