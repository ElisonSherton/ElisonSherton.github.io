This post is built for documentation and self-revision and wouldn't be structured very well. It is written with the intent to remember basic concepts of mathematics which will inevitably be needed to study any discipline which involves quantitative analysis.

## Sets

A set is a collection of items.

**Sets are unordered**. They are not sequences and duplicates don't matter.

*Cardinality* of a set is the number of elements in the set. When the items in a set are countable, that's a finite set and when you cannot count the number of elements, it's an infinite set. Infinite sets cannot be listed out (meh, obviosuly!).

> Not every collection of items is a set. for eg. collection of all sets is not a set (Russel's Paradox)

## Elements

*Items of a set are called elements*. They could be written as

\\[ 5 \in \mathbb{N}, -6 \not\in \mathbb{N} \\]

## Subsets

`X` is a subset of `Y` iff every element of `X` is in `Y`. It is denoted as

\\[ \mathbb{N} \subset \mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{Z} \subset \mathbb{Q}, \mathbb{R} \not\subset \mathbb{Q}, \\]

Every set is a subset of itself.

### Equality of sets

Two sets `X` and `Y` are equal iff \\( \mathbb{X} \subseteq \mathbb{Y} & \mathbb{Y} \subseteq \mathbb{X}\\) 

Proper subset means the two sets aren't equal and one set is a subset of the other and not the other way round. For eg. Naturals are proper subset of Integers.

## Empty set & Powerset

Empty set has no elements and is denoted by \\( \Phi \\)

Powerset is a set of subsets of a given set (including the empty set).

A set with n elements has \\( 2^n \\) subsets.

## Set Comprehension

We can only do Set comprehension only when we have an existing set. Then we take some elements (filter from that set) and prepare the subset.


A set of all even integers could be \\( {x | x \in Z, x % 2 = 0} \\)

A set of perfect squares is  \\( {x | x \in N, \sqrt{x} \in N} \\)

Closed Intervals -> [0,1] is a set such that \\( {x | x \in \mathbb{X} 0 \lteq r \lteq 1 \\)

Open Intervals -> [0,1] is a set such that \\( {x | x \in \mathbb{X} 0 \lt r \lt 1 \\)

Union - Combinatin of two sets. denoted as \\( X \cup Y \\)

Intersection - Common elements across two sets. Denoted as \\( X \cap Y \\)

Set Difference - X - Y or X \ Y means elements in X but not in Y. 

Complement - elements not in X \\( \bar{X} \\), it is always defined wrt a Universal Set to specify bounds from which to pick the subset.
